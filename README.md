# Plukkit
## What is Plukkit?
First things first, this idea was inspired by [Carbon](https://github.com/dawnlabs/carbon), so 
credit to them for the amazing idea. I hadn't even used it before thinking "why not bring it to 
desktop?" Ironically, without looking at the code for Carbon before setting Plukkit up, it turns 
out they both are pretty similar code wise. Plukkit uses the following libraries/technologies:
- Electron 
- AngularJS
- CodeMirror
- [dom-to-image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image)
- [electron-is](https://github.com/delvedor/electron-is)
- [electron-settings](https://github.com/nathanbuchar/electron-settings)
- [gh-release](https://github.com/hypermodules/gh-release)
- icons by [Ion](http://ionicons.com/)

## How do I use it?
For now, the only way to use it is by cloning due to active development and it's not ready for a full 
release yet. That means you take full responsibility for anything that happens to your system by 
running Plukkit. 

## Can I contribute?
Of course. If you see something that could use improving, just submit a pull request and I'll get to it 
ASAP.

Honestly, I don't care. Use it. Abuse it. Be free.
